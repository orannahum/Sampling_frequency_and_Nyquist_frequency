# sampling_frequency_and_Nyquist_frequency.
The program can be seen when the effect of the sampling frequency and the relationship to the Nyquist frequency.

We created a cosine signal with a frequency of 60Hz. We sampled at a sampling frequency of:

1.800Hz

2.400Hz

3.120Hz

4.70Hz

And we saw what happened when we retrieved a signal that was less than a Nyquist frequency.
